Diverse executive sales team in a triangular leadership formation: three to four professionals in tailored business attire, confident poses, reviewing growth projections on a large central screen. The screen displays a subtle, premium SaaS product UI (CRM dashboard with charts and metrics), soft glow, not dominant. Shallow depth of field, 85mm lens, shot on medium format. Lighting: cool blue fill from the windows and screens, warm edge light and rim light on the subjects for an innovation-meets-confidence feel. Mood: intelligent, premium, confident, B2B. Composition: people form a triangle with the screen as focal point; clear negative space in the top-left for headline text; clear negative space in the bottom-right for CTA. Realistic photography, editorial magazine quality, high dynamic range, ultra realistic textures. Global brand advertising style, award-winning campaign visual. No distorted anatomy, no extra products, no text artifacts, no watermark.`;
